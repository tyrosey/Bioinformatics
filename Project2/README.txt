This Project was created in python.

I tested this program on the CS Server each time. 

To test, type "python project1.py" after uploading to the server. 

I did not link paths for each testing file.
I uploaded each specific text file needed (separately) to the exact directory my project was located in (on the server of course).
They were not buried in another directory/folder inside of the directory my program file was in. 


NOTABLE ERRORS/ISSUES:

Some of the OPT alignments differ when tested on EMBOSS, but I am fairly confident I implemented the project correctly.
