Optimal Alignments

This Project was created in python and tested on a school server via ssh.

To test, type "python project1.py" after uploading to a server. 


I did not link paths for each testing file.
I uploaded each specific text file needed (separately) to the exact directory the python file was located in (on the server of course).
They were not buried in another directory/folder inside of the main directory. 


NOTABLE ERRORS/ISSUES:

Some of the OPT alignment outputs differ from EMBOSS testing, but the program is still correct.
